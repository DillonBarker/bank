Outline:
- Needs deposit, withdrawal and a statement print
- Data is kept in memory, no db

Initial plan:
    Classes:
    - Printer { methods: print_statement }
    - Account { methods: deposit, withdraw, get_balance attributes: balance }

Notes:
- changed print_statement to print_statement_header, so that it is more simple.

Updated plan:
    Classes:
    - Printer { methods: print_statement, print_statement_header }
    - Account { methods: deposit, withdraw, get_balance attributes: balance }
    - Transaction { methods: credit, debit } ? -> Here I want some way of getting either a credit
    or debit transaction type which I can input into the statement alongside the amount of that type
    and the balance at the end.
